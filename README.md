# Email_Bomber-InfoSec-Hacking


In Internet usage, an email bomb is a form of net abuse consisting of sending large volumes of email to an address in an attempt to overflow the mailbox, overwhelm the server where the email address is hosted in a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack) or as a smoke screen to distract the attention from important email messages indicating a security breach.

This tool is only for testing and can only be used where strict consent has been given. Do not use it for illegal purposes! It is the end user's responsibility to obey all applicable local, state and federal laws. Developers assume no liability and are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this tool and software in general.

This program spams the target email address by sending any number of mail. 
Normally, SMTP servers will automatically block you after sending 100 mails. I bypassed this security step by 'sleep' commands and repetitive logins. Now, even tens of thousands of email can be sent to unsecure email adresses.
